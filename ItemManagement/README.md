User Stories

  - ~~As a user, I can create a new Item~~
    - ~~As a user, I can view all Items~~
    - ~~As a user, I can view a singular Item by its ID (HINT: Use Path Params to select a Item by its ID)~~
    - ~~As a user, I can update a Item (Change the name or other properties)~~
    - As a user, I can delete a Item by its ID (HINT: Use Path Params to select a Item by its ID)
    - As a user, I can create an account to hold my Items
    - As a user, I can login to my account (which is stored in the database)
    - As a user, I can view the Items associated with my account

- Other Optional Requirements include the following:
    - Giving accounts roles (USER and ADMIN) so Admins can view everyone's Items while a User can only view their own
    - Using JUnit to test Service Layer methods (70% coverage at least would be optimal)
